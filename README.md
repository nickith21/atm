# Title of the project:

ATM Project

# Description of the project:

This project allows you to simulate an ATM machine by depositing an amount of money and withdrawing an amount of money. It has been improved by adding an alert when the user has insufficient funds.

# How to Run:

- Clone this repo
- Open the index.html file in a browser
- Select the Deposit or the Cash Back button
- Input the amount that you would like to deposit or withdraw
- Press submit

# Roadmap of future improvements:

- Make the UI more asthetically pleasing by adding in a background of an ATM machine
- Add other changes to the UI to make it more clear on which action the user is making
